"""Where a finished event goes.

The port is domain-typed: a reporter takes a domain event and builds the payload itself, so
wire keys never leave payload.py and the two reporters. It returns a delivery verdict,
because HTTP 200 is not delivery: CrossWatch answers 200 for a rejected token, for a
disabled webhook source and for a route with no sink configured.

Each event is delivered only within two minutes of being handed over, which is the
contract's retry window measured from the event rather than from the attempt.
