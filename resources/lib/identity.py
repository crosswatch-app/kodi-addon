"""Who watched this: a pure decision, playlist then profile.

No I/O. The caller supplies the index and the active profile label, so this module is a
decision table its tests can exercise without any Kodi double at all. The prompt is the
third mechanism and lives in prompt.py, because it can only run after the stop event.

The log line carries the mechanism and the ids, never the names: identity is DEBUG, and
reaches only the addon's own file.
