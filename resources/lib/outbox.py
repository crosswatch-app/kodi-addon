"""Completed watches, kept on disk until CrossWatch accepts them.

The one event persisted. A lost stop loses who watched, which is what the addon exists to
report, and Kodi's own shared playcount cannot recover it. Everything else is only worth
sending while it is still true, so it stays in memory and expires.

An entry holds the exact payload that was built for sending, so a replay carries the
original event_id and sent_at, and a fingerprint of the webhook it was meant for, never the
token itself. A duplicate caused by a crash between acceptance and removal is harmless: the
receiving sinks dedupe or set an idempotent watched flag.
