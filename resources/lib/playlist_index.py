"""Smart playlist membership, resolved by asking Kodi to expand the playlist.

Files.GetDirectory on an .xsp returns the resolved members with their library ids, so no
.xsp parsing and no smart playlist logic is reimplemented. Membership is never decided by
comparing titles: a title rule can match two distinct library shows.

The build is incremental, one playlist per step, because an expansion costs a whole-library
query rather than a list read: tvshow_view INNER JOINs an aggregate over the episode table.
The controller steps it from the tick while nothing is playing, so the cost never lands on
the start of playback.

A failure is isolated to the viewers holding the playlist that failed, not to the build. The
index is published without them and names them in `degraded`, so one renamed playlist costs
its owner their playlist identity and costs nobody else anything.

Within a viewer it stays all or nothing. A viewer holding two lists, one of which failed,
is dropped entirely rather than indexed from the half that worked: a partial set attributes
the shows it happens to contain and silently misses the rest, which reads as an answer
rather than as a failure.
