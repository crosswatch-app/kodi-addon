"""Domain event to wire format.

The only file that knows the payload shape. It implements docs/contract.md on
crosswatch-app/kodi-addon; a spelling change there lands here and nowhere else. It is not a
firewall against every contract change: a change to what the addon must resolve, such as one
event per viewer, reaches the event model too.

Two shapes share one entry point. A playback event carries media and a session; a ping
carries neither, and is a separate type precisely so that nothing handling playback has to
reason about a media that is absent.

Episodes are keyed on show ids plus season and episode number, because most episodes carry
no usable episode id.
